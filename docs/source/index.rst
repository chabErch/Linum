***********
Description
***********

If you need to visualize your schedule or
working plan you are welcome to use Linum.
Actually, you are able to use Gantt charts,
but they are overloaded with extra information
if you have many simple tasks.
Gantt charts are better when tasks are sequential
and connected between themselves.

Linum allows you to visualize your information on chosen time interval
(week, month, year) like a timetable briefly and convenient.
